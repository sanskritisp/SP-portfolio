                <h1>FIRST: Difference between UNDEFINED and NOT-DEFINED in JS.</h1>
            <small>September,2021</small>
            <p>Hey everyone! Are you also new in the journey of javascript? So, let’s shake the hands. I have too started learning this language called javascript a few days ago. But believe me, now I think it is one of the best languages to work with. Today I m here with an interesting topic about javascript i.e. difference between Undefined and Not-Defined.
                So one day while I was coding using javascript I found two different statements coming in the console. One was undefined and the other was not defined. Many people think that both are the same but the case is different. Let’s dive deep down into them to get the clarity between both of them.</p>

                <h1>SECOND: WEB DESIGNING</h1>
                <small>September,2021</small>
                <p>I have started my route towards web development recently and I think that being in the industry of web development is way far better than anything. I have just started learning about the concepts, theory and gaining practical knowledge of web development.
                    As I have started my journey recently the part which I m enjoying the most is the designing part of a webpage or a website. In my opinion, a well-designed website is important for communicating or viewing our ideas and points to others. A properly designed website is more effective for the viewers. </p>
